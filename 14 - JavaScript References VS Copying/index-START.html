    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'

    // however what happens when we update that array?


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() // a copy!!

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players) // same thing

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players] // also a copy
    team4[3] = 'Barbra'

    const team5 = Array.from(players) // another copy

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Yuri',
      age: 20
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99 // just a reference

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 })

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
